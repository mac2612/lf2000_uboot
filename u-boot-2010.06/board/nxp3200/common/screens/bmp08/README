This directory contains the screens used in U-Boot.

The program tools/bin_header.c converts the screen into the header
file 'include/screens.h'.  The list of screens to convert is in
the tools/Makefile; search for the SCREENS variable define.
Note that the FileName becomes the character array name with '_'
substituted for non-alphanumberic characters to form a valid
C language file array.  So 'Logo.bmp' becomes 'Logo_bmp'
